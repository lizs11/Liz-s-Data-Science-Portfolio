# Data science classwork

This repository contains COMP2200 Data Science practical tasks, demonstrating familiarity with the Python and Markdown language, popular Python modules such as Numpy and Pandas (data structures and data frames), Matplotlib and Seaborn (data plotting and visualisation). Some classwork from COMP3210 Big Data is also included, namely small projects involving Dask, divide and conquer (quick sort and closest pair methods), and Binary Tree implementation. 

The standard Data Science workflow is also utilised in multiple tasks - data exploration, model building (train test split), predicting and evaluating results. Models constructed include simple linear least squares (Mean Square Error MSE and R squared variance measure), Linear and Logistic regression (including Feature selection), Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.
