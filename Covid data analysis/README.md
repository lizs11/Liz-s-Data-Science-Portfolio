# Data Science Project (2021) - Covid Data Analysis

This project involved analysis of COVID-19 infections in Australia and how they are affected by the stringency of lockdowns. The aim was to find and explore any links between the strength of lockdowns and the subsequent COVID-19 cases. 

A number of data sources relevant to the stringency index/cases relationship were gathered. Datasets in csv format from official, trusted Australian Government websites for COVID-19 case and death data from July-December 2020 were used. 

To include lockdown strength in the analysis, accurate open source websites from around the world were utilised. The Stringency Index measures the strength (or harshness) of COVID-19 lockdowns worldwide.

Some analysis techniques implemented include linear regression, corresponding accuracy score, and prediction model.
