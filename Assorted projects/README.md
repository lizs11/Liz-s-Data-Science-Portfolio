# Assorted projects

This repository contains the files for some assorted projects completed as part of the coursework for Data Science (COMP2200 - 2021) and Big Data (COMP3210 - 2023) at Macquarie University.

Portfolio 1 involved data filtering, description, and summarisation, among other things. The data was filtered according to reasonable assumptions and restrictions, To describe and summarise the data, it was explored and manipulated, including through visualisation where graphs were generated. 

Portfolio 2 involved significant amounts of data manipulation and filtering. This enabled meaningful results to be developed, visualisation to be observed through generating various plots, and calculation of correlation. 

Portfolio 3 involved building, analysing and evaluating models with different combinations of features to predict a mobile phone customer leaving their provider. Data filtering and visualisation assisted in identifying relevant data to feed into the models. 

The R-Tree implementation to answer range queries was compared with sequential scanning based on the time taken to answer queries (and also build up the R-Tree).
